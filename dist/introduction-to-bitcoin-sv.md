# Lesson 1.1: Understanding the Roots of Bitcoin SV

This lesson aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the roots and philosophies that have shaped Bitcoin SV (BSV).

## Learning Outcomes
1. Explain the origins of Bitcoin SV and its relationship to Bitcoin Cash.
2. Discuss the Scalability2X roadmap and its impact on BSV.
3. Understand the importance of on-chain scaling in BSV's design philosophy.
4. Demonstrate the ability to create simple transactions using Python or JavaScript.
5. Recognize real-world examples of BSV applications.

## Origins and Relationship to Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin SV is a hard fork of Bitcoin ABC that occurred in November 2018. It was created due to disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community over scaling solutions and philosophical differences about the original vision for Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. BSV aims to restore the original Bitcoin protocol by emphasizing on-chain scaling, eliminating off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network, and focusing on enterprise use cases.

## Scalability2X Roadmap
The Scalability2X roadmap is a set of proposed upgrades that aim to increase Bitcoin SV's capacity significantly. The plan includes increasing the block size limit from 128MB (currently) to 2GB, and eventually to 128GB. This allows BSV to handle more transactions per second, making it suitable for high-volume applications like microtransactions and enterprise solutions.

## Real-world BSV Example:
Consider the [HandCash Wallet](https://www.handcash.io/), a popular mobile wallet that supports BSV. HandCash allows users to send and receive micropayments for content, making it an excellent example of how BSV's focus on high-volume transactions benefits real-world applications.

## Discussion Questions
1. How does the focus on on-chain scaling differentiate Bitcoin SV from other cryptocurrencies?
2. What are some potential downsides to increasing the block size limit as planned in the Scalability2X roadmap?
3. In what ways could enterprise solutions benefit from using Bitcoin SV's high-capacity network?

## Hands-On Exercises
1. Write a simple Python script that creates and broadcasts a BSV transaction to the testnet network.
2. Implement a JavaScript solution for creating a transaction using an external API like [Memo.cash](https://memo.cash/api) or [nChain APIs](https://apidocs.nchain.com/) and broadcasting it on the testnet network.

# Lesson 1.2: Important Concepts for Beginners in Bitcoin SV

In this lesson, we will delve into fundamental concepts that are crucial for beginners to understand when working with Bitcoin SV (BSV). By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand the difference between Bitcoin SV and other cryptocurrencies.
2. Recognize the importance of block size in BSV.
3. Grasp the concept of Satoshis and its role in BSV.
4. Comprehend the significance of Script in BSV transactions.
5. Appreciate the role of Mempool and Confirmations in transaction processing.

## 1. Bitcoin SV Overview
Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) is a hard-fork of Bitcoin Cash, aimed at restoring the original vision of Bitcoin as a scalable electronic cash system. It prioritizes larger block sizes to improve transaction speed and lower fees.

### Example:
A grocery store uses BSV to process thousands of transactions per day without incurring high fees or waiting for confirmations.

## 2. Block Size
In Bitcoin SV, each block can contain up to 2GB worth of transactions (as opposed to approximately 1MB in Bitcoin), allowing for a significantly increased transaction capacity.

### Example:
During peak shopping hours, the grocery store is able to process thousands of transactions in just one block due to BSV's larger block size.

## 3. Satoshis
A single unit of bitcoin is referred to as a Satoshi, named after Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In BSV, each Satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 BSV.

### Example:
When scanning QR codes to pay for items at the grocery store, customers can easily keep track of their total spending in Satoshis on their smartphones.

## 4. Script
In Bitcoin SV, Script is a stack-based programming language used for defining conditions within transactions, such as multi-signature requirements or time locks.

### Example:
The grocery store might use Script to implement a loyalty program where customers receive rewards based on their cumulative spending over a certain period.

## 5. Mempool and Confirmations
Transactions are temporarily stored in the Mempool (Memory Pool) before being included in a block and receiving confirmations. More confirmations mean greater trust that the transaction will not be reversed or double-spent.

### Example:
When paying for groceries, customers want their transactions to have multiple confirmations to ensure they won't encounter any issues with payment processing.

## Discussion Questions
1. How does Bitcoin SV aim to differentiate itself from other cryptocurrencies in terms of scalability and transaction fees?
2. What are some potential use cases for the Script language in real-world applications using BSV?
3. How can businesses like the grocery store benefit from utilizing BSV over traditional payment methods?

## Hands-On Exercises
1. Write a simple Python script to create and send a Bitcoin SV transaction with multiple confirmations using an appropriate library such as `bsv`.
2. Develop a JavaScript application that calculates the total cost of items purchased by a customer in Satoshis and displays it on their screen.

# Lesson 2.1: Blockchain Basics and Scalability Solutions in Bitcoin SV

## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, focusing on Bitcoin SV (BSV). By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand the basic structure and functions of a blockchain.
2. Recognize the key features of the Bitcoin SV network.
3. Grasp scalability solutions implemented in BSV.
4. Write simple transactions on the BSV blockchain using Python or JavaScript.
5. Evaluate real-world applications of BSV's scalability solutions.

## Blockchain Basics
A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. Each block in the chain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data.

```markdown
block:
  - index
  - hash
  - previous_hash
  - timestamp
  - transactions
```

### Real-world BSV example:
In the world of commerce, a blockchain can be used to create a secure, transparent, and immutable record of sales transactions. For instance, a BSV-based marketplace allows buyers and sellers to conduct transactions directly without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors.

## Bitcoin SV Network Features
Bitcoin SV aims to restore the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto by focusing on scalability, simplicity, and minimum disruptive changes to the protocol.

1. Large Block Sizes: BSV supports larger block sizes (currently 2GB) allowing for more transactions per second compared to other blockchains.
2. Scripting Language: BSV has an extensive scripting language that enables developers to create complex applications on top of the blockchain.
3. Mempool Prioritization: BSV's MemPool prioritizes transactions based on their size, ensuring larger transactions are confirmed faster.

## Scalability Solutions in Bitcoin SV

1. **Child Pays for Parent (CPFP):** CPFP allows users to include a payment to the miner who confirms an older transaction, ensuring that their own transaction is processed quickly.
2. **OP_Return:** OP_Return allows for storing large amounts of data within transactions without the need for additional blocks.
3. **Increased Block Size Limit:** The increased block size limit enables the processing of more transactions per second compared to other blockchains.

## Example Python Code (CPFP)

```python
import bitcoin
from bitcoin.utils import reverse_hex, sha256d

# Create new Bitcoin SV wallet and keys
wallet = bitcoin.core.Wallet()

# Generate transaction data
tx_data = {'version': 1, 'vin': [], 'vout': [], 'locktime': 0, 'nLockTime': 0}

# Replace-by-Fee (RBF) transaction
rbf_txid = "YOUR_REPLACEABLE_TXID"

# Create CPFP transaction
cpfp_tx = bitcoin.core.CMutableTransaction()
prev_out = cpfp_tx.add_previous_output(bitcoin.script, rbf_txid, 0)
change_address = wallet.get_receive_address()
cpfp_tx.add_output(bitcoin.script.ScriptPubKey.pay_to_pubkey_hash(prev_out.scriptPubKey).get_pubkey(), change_amount)

# Add CPFP input with a higher fee to replace the original transaction
input = cpfp_tx.add_input(prev_out, sequence=prev_out.nSequence+4294967295)

# Sign and serialize the transaction
cpfp_tx_serialized = bitcoin.core.serialize_transaction(cpfp_tx)
signed_tx = wallet.signrawtransaction(cpfp_tx_serialized, ['hex'])['hex']

# Broadcast the CPFP transaction to the BSV network
bitcoin.network.p2p.rpc_client('YOUR_NODE_RPC_URL').sendrawtransaction(signed_tx)
```

## Discussion Questions:
1. How can scalability solutions in Bitcoin SV benefit businesses and developers?
2. Compare the advantages of using BSV's CPFP mechanism over other blockchain networks.
3. What challenges might developers face when implementing real-world applications on top of a large-blockchain like Bitcoin SV?

## Hands-On Exercises:
1. Write a Python script to create and sign a simple transaction using the provided example as a starting point. Broadcast your transaction to a BSV testnet node.
2. Research and implement a real-world application that leverages the scalability solutions in Bitcoin SV, then present your findings to the class.

# Lesson 2.2: Understanding the Bitcoin SV Consensus Mechanism and Mining Process

In this lesson, we will delve deeper into the heart of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) network, focusing on its consensus mechanism and mining process. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Describe the role and benefits of the BSV's Consensus Mechanism.
2. Understand the key components of the BSV mining process.
3. Compare and contrast the BSV mining process with other blockchain networks.
4. Implement simple Bitcoin SV transactions using Python or JavaScript.
5. Analyze a BSV block to understand its structure and miner rewards.

## 1. The Bitcoin SV Consensus Mechanism

The Bitcoin SV network employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to Bitcoin and many other blockchain networks. The goal is to prevent double-spending by ensuring that all participants agree on the current state of the blockchain.

```markdown
In BSV, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems known as "hash puzzles" using a specialized algorithm called SHA-256D. Miners who successfully find a solution (a valid hash) are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins and transaction fees from the block they have mined.
```

## 2. The BSV Mining Process

The BSV mining process can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Mining Hardware:** A miner needs a powerful computer (mining rig) with multiple GPUs or ASICs to perform hash calculations efficiently.
2. **Joining a Mining Pool:** Due to the high computational requirements and the unpredictable block-finding interval, miners often join mining pools for increased chances of earning rewards.
3. **Collecting Transactions:** Miners gather transactions from the BSV network, verifying their validity before including them in a new block.
4. **Creating a Block:** Once enough transactions have been collected, a miner creates a new block by organizing them and adding essential metadata like timestamps, nonces, and the previous block's hash.
5. **Finding a Valid Hash:** The miner then attempts to find a valid hash for the newly created block by incrementing the nonce value and applying the SHA-256D algorithm until a solution is found.
6. **Broadcasting the Block:** Once a valid hash has been discovered, the mined block is broadcasted across the network for other nodes to verify its validity.
7. **Block Verification:** The miner's peers validate the newly mined block by ensuring that it follows the BSV protocol rules and contains no double-spent transactions or malicious code. If the block is valid, it gets added to the blockchain, and the miner receives the corresponding rewards.

## 3. Real-World Example: Mining a BSV Block

A large mining operation named CoinGeek runs one of the largest BSV mining pools. With their specialized ASIC miners, they can mine a new block approximately every ten minutes and collect transaction fees from each block as well as the newly minted Bitcoins.

## 4. Discussion Questions

1. How does the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism contribute to the security of the Bitcoin SV network?
2. What are the potential downsides of using a PoW consensus mechanism, and why is it still preferred by some networks like BSV?
3. Why do miners often join mining pools rather than mining solo, even though pooled rewards may be lower?

## 5. Hands-On Exercises

1. Write Python code to create and sign a simple Bitcoin SV transaction using the [`bsv` library](https://github.com/memos-io/bitcoin-script-language).
2. Experiment with mining a test block on the [BSV Testnet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet) using your own node or a cloud mining service like [MemoPool](https://memopool.space/) or [BTC.com](https://btc.com/).

# Lesson 3.1: Smart Contracts, Scripting, and Business Transactions on Bitcoin SV

This lesson introduces the concept of smart contracts, scripting, and business transactions on Bitcoin SV (BSV). By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Understand the role of smart contracts in digital assets management.
2. Write and deploy simple smart contracts on the BSV blockchain.
3. Learn how to integrate smart contracts with real-world business transactions.
4. Understand the benefits of using scripting languages for BSV applications.
5. Analyze various use cases of smart contracts in different industries.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that automates the execution of an agreement, ensuring that all parties involved abide by its terms. On the Bitcoin SV blockchain, smart contracts are known as **op_RETURN** transactions and can be used to store data on the blockchain.

### Example: Digital Art Auction

Let's consider a simple digital art auction scenario where an artist sells their artwork through a smart contract on BSV. The smart contract includes details such as the artwork's name, price, and bid history. When someone places a bid, the smart contract checks if it is higher than the current highest bid and updates the bid history accordingly.

## Scripting Languages

Scripting languages like Python and JavaScript can be used to write smart contracts for BSV. These languages provide an easy-to-understand syntax that makes it simple to create and deploy smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Example: Python Code for Digital Art Auction

```python
import hashlib
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def make_transaction(name, artist, initial_bid, expiration):
    bid_history = [(initial_bid, artist)]
    auction_data = f"{name}: {', '.join(str(i) for i in bid_history)}"
    tx_hash = hashlib.sha256(auction_data.encode()).hexdigest()

    # Create a transaction with the auction data and op_RETURN
    # ... (Replace placeholders with actual values and sign the transaction)

def bid(tx, new_bid, current_bid):
    if new_bid > current_bid:
        bid_history = parse_auction_data(tx)
        bid_history.append((new_bid, "Bidder"))
        auction_data = f"{name}: {', '.join(str(i) for i in bid_history)}"
        signed_transaction = sign_and_broadcast_transaction(auction_data)
    else:
        print("Your bid is lower than the current highest bid.")

def parse_auction_data(tx):
    # Parse the auction data from the transaction
    # ... (Retrieve the op_RETURN data and convert it to a list of bids)

# Example usage:
name = "My Artwork"
artist = "John Doe"
initial_bid = 10000000
expiration = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7)
make_transaction(name, artist, initial_bid, expiration)
```

## Discussion Questions

1. How can smart contracts improve trust and efficiency in business transactions?
2. What are the potential risks associated with using smart contracts on a blockchain like BSV?
3. Can you think of other industries where smart contracts could be beneficial?

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Digital Art Auction Smart Contract Deployment

Following the provided Python code example, deploy and test your own digital art auction smart contract on the BSV blockchain. Modify the example to include a winner announcement feature when the auction ends.

### Exercise 2: Custom Smart Contract Development

Create a custom smart contract for a scenario of your choice (e.g., ticket sales, supply chain management). Write the Python or JavaScript code to define and deploy the smart contract on BSV, and provide an explanation of how it can be integrated into a real-world business transaction.

5. Familiarize yourself with essential regulatory considerations for BSV businesses.

## Security Measures in BSV Transactions
Bitcoin SV places a high emphasis on security, leveraging features such as **scriptPubKey** and **OP_RETURN** to ensure the integrity of transactions.

```python
import bitcoin
from bitcoin import util

tx = bitcoin.Tx()
input = tx.vin.append(bitcoin.TxIn(prevout=utxo, scriptSig=[]))
output = tx.vout.append(bitcoin.Output(scriptPubKey=bitcoin.OP_RETURN + bytes('Hello, World!', 'ascii')))
tx.serialize()
signed_tx = bitcoin.SigningContext(message=util.double_sha256(tx.serialize()))
input.witness_uts = [utxo.scriptPubKey. witness_program]
input.witnesses = [bitcoin.ECDSA_SIG(sig, hash_type=signing_context.hash_type) for sig in signatures]
signed_tx.sign(private_key, input)
```

## Governance in the BSV Network
The Bitcoin SV network relies on a **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus mechanism, which ensures the network's decentralization and security. Miners compete to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

## Regulation in BSV
Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential for BSV businesses. Anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are common measures employed by exchanges and other financial institutions to maintain a secure and trustworthy environment.

## Discussion Questions
1. What are the benefits of the PoW consensus mechanism in maintaining the security and decentralization of the BSV network?
2. How can AML and KYC procedures improve the integrity of transactions within the BSV ecosystem?
3. Can you identify potential regulatory challenges that may arise for BSV businesses operating across various jurisdictions?

## Hands-On Exercises

A BSV transaction is a digital document that transfers value between addresses. It consists of:
- Inputs: Previous unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) used as a source to fund the transaction.
- Outputs: New UTXOs created by the transaction, which represent the destination address and the amount received.
- Scripts: Rules governing how inputs can be spent and outputs can be claimed.

## Example: Sending BSV
To send BSV from one address to another, we'll use a Python library called `bsvpy`. First, install it using pip:
```bash
pip install bsvpy
```

Here's an example of sending 10 BSV from `source_address` to `destination_address`:

```python
import bsvpy
from bsvpy.wallet import Wallet

# Create a wallet instance and load the private key
wallet = Wallet("path/to/private_key.txt")

# Send 10 BSV from source address to destination address
txn = wallet.sendtoaddress(destination_address, 10000, "Payment for goods")

# Sign and broadcast the transaction
txn.sign('mine')
txn.broadcast()
```

## Querying Transaction Details
To query transaction details from the BSV blockchain, we'll use a JavaScript library called `bsv-sdk`. First, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install bsv-sdk
```

Here's an example of fetching the transaction details for a given hash:

```javascript
const BSV = require('bsv');

// Fetch transaction details by hash
function getTransaction(txid) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const blockchain = BSV.Blockchain();
    blockchain.getRawTransaction(txid, (err, tx) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(tx);
    });
  });
}
```

## Discussion Questions
1. What are the key components of a BSV transaction?
2. How can you verify that a transaction has been included in a block on the BSV blockchain?
3. What steps would you take to secure your BSV wallet and prevent unauthorized access?

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Modify the Python script above to send a different amount of BSV.
2. Write a JavaScript function that queries the balance of a given address on the BSV blockchain using `bsv-sdk`.

# Lesson 4.2: Trading and Managing Bitcoin SV on Exchanges

This lesson aims to provide an understanding of how to trade and manage Bitcoin SV (BSV) on various exchanges, focusing on security, trading strategies, and transaction management.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand the process of setting up an account on a Bitcoin SV exchange.
2. Learn how to deposit, withdraw, and trade BSV on popular exchanges.
3. Grasp the concept of managing transactions in a secure manner on the BSV blockchain.
4. Familiarize yourself with basic trading strategies for Bitcoin SV.
5. Comprehend the role of wallets in handling BSV transactions.

## Setting up an Account on a Bitcoin SV Exchange
To start trading BSV, you'll need to create an account on a reputable exchange that supports it (e.g., [BSVex](https://www.bsvex.com/)). Follow the provided instructions for verification and account setup.

## Depositing and Withdrawing Bitcoin SV
Depositing BSV into your exchange account is straightforward, usually involving copying your wallet address from the exchange to a wallet you control (e.g., [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/)). Withdrawals require you to reverse this process.

Here's an example of Python code to deposit BSV into an exchange:

```python
from electrumsv import ElectrsClient, Wallet

client = ElectrsClient()
wallet = Wallet(client)

# Get the exchange address
exchange_address = 'your_exchange_address'

# Send BSV to the exchange
txid = wallet.sendtoaddress(exchange_address, 1000)
print("Transaction ID:", txid)
```

## Trading Bitcoin SV
Trading BSV involves placing buy and sell orders according to market conditions. Familiarize yourself with key concepts such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders. Most exchanges provide an easy-to-use interface for managing these orders.

Here's a JavaScript code sample demonstrating placing a basic buy order using the [BSVex API](https://api.bsvex.com/):

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function tradeBsv(exchange_key, market) {
    const response = await axios({
        url: 'https://api.bsvex.com/trade',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'x-api-key': exchange_key,
        },
        data: {
            symbol: market,
            side: 'buy',
            quantity: 0.1,
            price: 500, // example price in cents
            type: 'limit',
        }
    });

    console.log("Order ID:", response.data.orderId);
}
```

## Managing Transactions on the BSV Blockchain
Managing transactions involves sending and receiving BSV securely, monitoring transaction statuses, and ensuring transaction confirmation. This is crucial for both personal transactions and trading activities.

Here's a Python code example that monitors the confirmation of a recent transaction:

```python
from electrumsv import ElectrsClient

client = ElectrsClient()
txid = 'your_transaction_id'
confirmations = client.get_tx(txid, include_mempool=False)['confirmations']
print("Confirmations:", confirmations)
```

## Discussion Questions
1. What are some best practices for securing your Bitcoin SV assets on an exchange?
2. How can you use limit orders to minimize risk when trading BSV?
3. In what ways can managing transactions on the BSV blockchain help improve your trading strategy?

## Hands-On Exercises

# Lesson: Assessment Types (Bitcoin SV)

This lesson will provide an overview of the various assessment types available within the Bitcoin SV ecosystem. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand and differentiate between scriptPubKey (SPK) types in Bitcoin SV transactions.
2. Implement and explain the purpose of each SPK type using Python or JavaScript code examples.
3. Recognize real-world Bitcoin SV use cases for each SPK type.

## Lesson Content

### 1. **Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH)**

P2PKH is the most common output type in Bitcoin transactions, where funds are sent to a recipient's Bitcoin address. The bitcoin address is derived from the first 160 bits of a cryptographic hash function applied to the sender's public key.

**Real-world example:** Sending BSV to a recipient's address using an online wallet service.

```python
from bitcoin.utils import encode_base58, dhash160

# Replace your public key with the sender's public key
sender_pubkey = b'\x04\x88\xB2\x1E\x13\x12\x9C\xD2... (Your Public Key)'

# Generate Bitcoin SV address from sender's public key hash
address = encode_base58(dhash160(sender_pubkey)[::-1])
print("Bitcoin SV Address:", address)
```

### 2. **Pay to Script Hash (P2SH)**

P2SH allows more complex scripts to be executed, which can enforce specific conditions for funds to be spent. The output is a hash of the redeemScript, and the input script contains OP_HASH160 followed by the hash of the redeemScript.

```python
from bitcoin.scripts import Script, OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG
from bitcoin.keys import HDKey

# Generate a new private key and corresponding Bitcoin SV address
private_key = HDKey().derive('m/44' + b'\x80' + b'\x00' + b'\x2C' + b'\x7B').hd_key.to_wif(compressed=True)
address = encode_base58(private_key[::-1])
print("Bitcoin SV Address:", address)

# RedeemScript: spend the BSV only if a specific public key provides the signature
redeemScript = Script([OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, address.encode(), OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG])

# P2SH output
p2sh_output = Script.from_hex("56" + redeemScript.to_hex()[::-1])
```

### 3. **Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH)**

P2WPKH is similar to P2PKH but designed for transactions with Segwit input. The witness program contains the redeemScript, and the scriptSig includes a signature from the sender's private key.

```javascript
const BitcoinSV = require('bsv');
const HDKey = BitcoinSV.HDKey;
const address = new BitcoinSV.Address(private_key.toWIF());

// RedeemScript: spend the BSV only if a specific public key provides the signature
redeemScript = BitcoinSV.Script.buildPublicKeyHashOutPoint({ network, hash: address.scriptHash() });

// P2WPKH output
p2wpkh_output = BitcoinSV.Script.fromAddressOutput(address);
```

## Discussion Questions
1. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using P2SH compared to P2PKH in Bitcoin SV transactions?
2. In what scenarios would you prefer using P2WPKH over P2PKH or P2SH?
3. Are there any potential security issues when using complex scripts in redeemScripts, and if so, how can they be mitigated?

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Implement a Python script that sends BSV from an address to another address using P2PKH.
2. Develop a JavaScript application that allows users to create their own Bitcoin SV addresses and generate corresponding redeemScripts for P2SH outputs.
