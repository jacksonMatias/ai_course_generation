### 1. Scalability and Microtransaction Vision

Bitcoin SV was created to restore the original vision of Bitcoin as a scalable, peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This involves:

> "...[S]caling Bitcoin to its original Satoshi's whitepaper specification, with no artificial block size limits, [and making it] the global public accounting blockchain for enterprise." - Craig S. Wright, nChain CEO

**Real-world BSV example:** The BSV-powered peer-to-peer marketplace OpenBazaar allows users to buy and sell goods without intermediaries. It can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it a scalable solution for microtransactions.

```python
# Python code example demonstrating creating a new transaction (note: this is not actual BSV code)
from bitcoin_sv import CBitcoinClient, CBTC

client = CBitcoinClient()
tx = client.create_new_transaction(0.01, "receiver_address", "change_address")
signed_tx = tx.sign(CBTC("private_key"))
broadcasted_tx_id = client.sendrawtransaction(signed_tx.hex())
print("Transaction ID:", broadcasted_tx_id)
```

### 2. Miner's Incentive and Satoshi's White Paper

The Bitcoin SV network follows the original whitepaper's principles, prioritizing the Miner's Incentive to secure the network. This incentivizes miners to include transactions with higher fees in their blocks.

**Real-world BSV example:** With high transaction fees, miners are incentivized to process more transactions quickly and efficiently, ensuring a stable and reliable network.

```javascript
// JavaScript code example demonstrating creating a new transaction (note: this is not actual BSV code)
const BitcoinSV = require("bitcoinsv-node");
const client = new BitcoinSV();
const tx = client.createNewTransaction({
    changeAddress: "change_address",
    outputs: [{
        address: "receiver_address",
        value: 0.01,
        scriptPubKey: BitcoinSV.Scripts.payToAddress(client.getDefaultNetwork())
    }],
    feeRate: 24 // 24 satoshis per virtual byte (vByte)
});
const txHex = client.serializeTransaction(tx);
const privateKey = BitcoinSV.Wallet.ECPrivKey.fromBase58("private_key");
const signedTx = client.signTransaction([privateKey], txHex);
const broadcastedTxId = client.sendRawTransaction(signedTx.toString('hex'));
console.log("Transaction ID:", broadcastedTxId);
```

### 3. Enterprise Adoption and BSV Support

BSV's focus on scalability, low fees, and smart contracts makes it an attractive choice for enterprise adoption. Many companies are already using BSV for various applications, including supply chain management and digital identity solutions.

**Real-world BSV example:** The BSV-powered digital identity platform Onesmart allows users to securely store, verify, and share their personal data with businesses.

### 4. Smart Contracts and Data on the BSV Blockchain

BSV supports smart contracts through its scripting language, enabling more complex transactions and business logic on the blockchain. Additionally, BSV stores vast amounts of data on its blockchain, making it a powerful platform for decentralized applications (DApps).

# Module 2: Bitcoin SV Transactions

## Lesson 2.2: Sending and Receiving Bitcoin SV Transactions

### Overview
In this lesson, you'll learn how to send and receive Bitcoin SV (BSV) transactions using Python or JavaScript. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

1. Send BSV transactions using a wallet API.
2. Receive BSV transactions to a new address.
3. Verify and decode BSV transactions.

### Sending Bitcoin SV Transactions

To send BSV transactions, we will use the [Bitcoin SV Web SDK](https://bsv-web-sdk.readthedocs.io/). Here's a simple example of sending a transaction using Python:

```python
from bsvpy import *

# Initialize Bitcoin SV instance with your node URL and credentials
bitcoinsv = BSV(url='http://your-node-url', username='your-username', password='your-password')

# Define input and output addresses for the transaction
input_address = 'bsv1q50gefk8yljts Bundled Address'
output_address = 'bsv1q3w942h5u4c90 Bundled Address'
amount = 5000

# Get UTXOs for the input address
utxos = bitcoinsv.get_utxo_for_address(input_address)

# Find a suitable UTXO to cover the output amount
utxo = sorted(utxos, key=lambda utxo: utxo['amount'], reverse=True)[0]

# Construct the transaction with the input and output scripts
tx = TxBuilder()
tx.add_input(utxo)
tx.add_output(output_address, amount)
tx.sign(private_key=PrivateKey(key='your-private-key'))

# Send the transaction to the Bitcoin SV network
txid = bitcoinsv.send_raw_transaction(str(tx))
print("Transaction sent with ID:", txid)
```

Replace the placeholders with your node URL, credentials, input address, output address, and private key for signing.

### Receiving Bitcoin SV Transactions

To receive BSV transactions, you can generate a new address using Python:

```python
from bsvpy import *

# Initialize Bitcoin SV instance with your node URL and credentials
bitcoinsv = BSV(url='http://your-node-url', username='your-username', password='your-password')

# Generate a new address for receiving BSV
address = bitcoinsv.new_address()
print("New receiving address:", address)
```

### Verifying and Decoding Transactions

To verify and decode transactions, we can use the [bsvpython](https://github.com/jnewbery/bsvpython) library in Python:

```python
from bsvpy import *

# Initialize Bitcoin SV instance with your node URL and credentials
bitcoinsv = BSV(url='http://your-node-url', username='your-username', password='your-password')

# Get the raw transaction hex data
raw_transaction = '01000000...0000'

# Decode the transaction into objects
tx_decoded = bitcoinsv.decode_tx(raw_transaction)

# Verify the transaction on the Bitcoin SV network
txid = bitcoinsv.get_tx_hash(tx_decoded)
block_height = bitcoinsv.get_block_count() - bitcoinsv.get_mempool_size() - 1
result = bitcoinsv.verify_tx(tx_decoded, block_height)
print("Transaction verified:", result)
```

### Discussion Questions

1. How does the Bitcoin SV network ensure that double-spending is avoided when multiple transactions are competing for the same inputs?
2. What are some potential challenges when sending and receiving BSV transactions, and how can they be addressed?

# Lesson 3.1: Understanding the Blockchain Structure (BSV)

This lesson provides an in-depth exploration of the blockchain structure within the Bitcoin SV (BSV) network.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Describe the fundamental components of a BSV blockchain.
2. Identify the role and significance of each component in maintaining the integrity of the network.
3. Explain how transactions are processed and verified on the BSV blockchain.

## Lesson Overview

This lesson delves into the intricate structure of the BSV blockchain, focusing on its components, transaction processing, and scalability. By understanding these concepts, you will gain a comprehensive grasp of how the BSV network functions.

## Understanding Blockchain Components

### The Block

A block is a collection of transactions that have been verified and added to the blockchain. It contains a header and a body.

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, timestamp, data_transactions):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data_transactions = data_transactions
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        # Calculate the hash of the block using a suitable hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256)
        pass
```

### The Blockchain

The blockchain is a linear sequence of blocks, each one linked to its predecessor by its unique hash. This creates an unalterable and secure chain of information.

## Real-world BSV Example

Let's consider the following transaction:

```
Alice sends 50 BSV to Bob on the BSV blockchain.
```

1. Alice creates a new transaction, specifying that she wants to send 50 BSV to Bob.
2. The network validates Alice's signature and checks her balance to ensure she has sufficient funds.
3. Once validated, the transaction is added to a block.
4. The block is broadcasted across the network for verification by other nodes.
5. Upon successful validation, the block is added to the end of the blockchain, marking the completion of Alice's transaction.

## Discussion Questions

1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a linear blockchain structure like BSV?
2. How does the block size impact the scalability of the BSV network?
3. Can you propose an alternative method for structuring a blockchain, and discuss its potential benefits and drawbacks?

## Hands-On Exercises

1. Implement the `Block` class in Python or JavaScript, including the hash calculation function.
2. Simulate a simple BSV network with two nodes and conduct a transaction between them. Verify that the transaction is successfully added to the blockchain.
```

# Lesson 3.2: Smart Contracts and Scripting on Bitcoin SV

This lesson will delve into the world of smart contracts and scripting on Bitcoin SV (BSV). By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand the concept of smart contracts and their role in blockchain technology.
2. Explore BSV's unique approach to scripting and its capabilities.
3. Learn how to write and deploy simple scripts on the BSV network.
4. Analyze real-world examples of smart contracts on BSV.
5. Discuss the potential implications and challenges of using smart contracts on BSV.

## Overview

In this lesson, we will discuss smart contracts and scripting on Bitcoin SV, a blockchain network that supports complex scripts, providing an environment for building decentralized applications (dApps).

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist on the blockchain network.

### BSV's Approach to Smart Contracts

Bitcoin SV supports complex scripts, which means that it can handle more data within its blocks compared to other blockchain networks. This allows for more robust smart contracts to be built on the BSV network.

#### Example: Implementing a Voting System

A simple voting system can be implemented on the BSV network using smart contracts. In this example, voters can cast their votes by sending a transaction with their vote data encoded within the scriptSig of the transaction. The scriptPubKey of the recipient's address would verify and count the votes.

```python
import base58
from bitcoin.utils import sigencode_der, encode_base58
from bitcoin.keys import ECPrivateKey, SECP256k1
from bitcoin.core import CScript, CTxIn, COutPoint, COIN
from bitcoin.script import Op

# Create private key and public key
private_key = ECPrivateKey(bytes.fromhex('your_private_key'))
public_key = private_key.pub

# Voting options
options = ['Option A', 'Option B']

# Encode voting options for use in scriptSig
encoded_options = [encode_base58(option.encode('ascii')) for option in options]

# Function to create a signature for a vote
def sign_vote(index, private_key):
    message = f'Vote {index}'.encode('utf-8')
    signature = sigencode_der(private_key, message)
    return signature

# Cast a vote
index = 0
signature = sign_vote(index, private_key)
vote_tx = CTxIn(COIN, COutPoint(0, 0))
vote_script = [Op.OP_0, Op.OP_PUSHDATA1, len(signature), signature, Op.OP_CHECKSIG]
vote_out = COutPoint(1, 0)
voting_script = CScript([Op.OP_IF, vote_script, Op.OP_ELSE, Op.OP_DROP, Op.OP_ENDIF])
voted_tx = CTxIn(vote_tx, voting_script)
```

## Discussion Questions

1. What are the advantages of using smart contracts on the BSV network compared to other blockchain networks?
2. How can smart contracts improve the efficiency and security of traditional business processes?
3. What potential challenges might arise when implementing smart contracts at scale on the BSV network?

## Hands-On Exercises

1. Write a simple script that allows for the transfer of funds only if the sender's public key matches a specific one.
2. Implement a smart contract to create a decentralized supply chain system where each step in the production process is recorded on the BSV blockchain.
```

Bitcoin SV offers built-in encryption functionality for secure communication between parties. The `OP_ENCODEVERIFY` and `OP_DROP` opcodes are commonly used to encrypt messages within transactions.

```python
import bitcoin
from bitcoin.utils import encode_base58, decode_base58

# Encrypt a message using Bitcoin SV's built-in encryption functionality
def encrypt_message(msg):
    tx = bitcoin.core.Transaction()
    input = bitcoin.core.TxIn(prev_out=bitcoin.core.OutPoint(), script_sig=bitcoin.script.CScript([bitcoin.opcodes.OP_DUP, bitcoin.opcodes.OP_HASH160, msg.hash, bitcoin.opcodes.OP_EQUALVERIFY, bitcoin.opcodes.OP_CHECKSIG]))
    output = bitcoin.core.TxOut(nValue=0, pkScriptPubKey=bitcoin.script.CScript([bitcoin.opcodes.OP_DUP, bitcoin.opcodes.OP_HASH160, msg.hash, bitcoin.opcodes.OP_EQUAL]) + bitcoin.script.ToWitness(msg))
    tx.add_input(input)
    tx.add_output(output)
    txid = tx.hash
    return encode_base58(txid.serialize())

# Decrypt a message using the encrypted transaction hash and private key
def decrypt_message(encrypted_txid, privkey):
    tx = bitcoin.core.Transaction().from_hex(bitcoin.core.deserialize_bch(decode_base58(encrypted_txid)))
    signature_hash = list(map(lambda txin: txin.signature_hash(), tx.inputs))[0]
    recovered_public_key, _ = bitcoin.ecrecover(signature_hash, privkey, recover=True)
    public_key = bitcoin.pubkey_to_address(recovered_public_key)
    output_script = tx.vout[0].scriptPubKey
    message_hash = output_script[3][::-1]
    message = bitcoin.hash160_to_bytes(message_hash).hex()
    return message.decode('utf-8')
```

# Module 4: Bitcoin SV Transactions and Security

## Lesson 4.2: Staying Informed and Protecting Your Investment

This lesson focuses on the importance of staying informed about market trends and securing your Bitcoin SV (BSV) investment.

### Learning Outcomes
1. Understand the importance of monitoring BSV market trends.
2. Learn how to securely store BSV using hardware wallets.
3. Grasp the concept of multi-signature wallets for enhanced security.
4. Recognize the role of Blockchain analytics tools in securing investments.
5. Comprehend the implications of regulatory changes on BSV investment.

### Monitoring BSV Market Trends
Monitoring market trends is crucial to making informed decisions about your BSV investment. You can use various online resources, such as [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-sv/) and [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/bsv), to track the price, volume, and market capitalization of BSV.

**Example:** By following the price fluctuations of BSV on CoinMarketCap, you can identify opportunities for buying or selling your investment to maximize profits.

### Securing Your BSV with Hardware Wallets
Hardware wallets are physical devices designed to securely store cryptocurrencies like BSV. Examples include Ledger and Trezor. These devices provide an additional layer of security by storing the private keys offline, making them less susceptible to hacking or theft.

```python
from bsvpython import Key, HDKey, Wallet

# Create a new HD wallet
hd_key = HDKey()
wallet = Wallet(private_key=hd_key.to_bytes())
```

**Example:** Connect your Ledger Nano X to your computer and use the Ledger Live application to manage your BSV holdings securely.

### Multi-Signature Wallets for Enhanced Security
Multi-signature wallets require multiple signatures (keys) to authorize transactions, providing an additional layer of security. This means that even if one key is compromised, the attacker would still need access to the other keys to steal your funds.

```javascript
const bsv = require('bsv');
const { HDKey } = bsv;

// Create a multi-sig wallet with 2 of 3 signatures required (privateKeys[0], privateKeys[1], and privateKeys[2])
const multiSigScript = bsv.scripts.multiSignature(2, [privateKeys[0].toPublicKey(), privateKeys[1].toPublicKey(), privateKeys[2].toPublicKey()]);
```

**Example:** Implement a 2-of-3 multisig wallet using the BSV Python library to secure your investment.

### Blockchain Analytics Tools for Securing Investments
Blockchain analytics tools help you monitor transactions on the blockchain and identify potential security threats, such as illegal activities or fraudulent transactions. Examples include Chainalysis and CipherTrace.

**Example:** Use Chainalysis to track the movement of BSV on the blockchain and identify any suspicious activity related to your investment.

### Discussion Questions
1. What are some advantages of using a hardware wallet for storing BSV?
2. How might multi-signature wallets help secure your BSV investment?
3. What role do blockchain analytics tools play in ensuring the security of BSV investments?

### Hands-On Exercises
1. Implement a 2-of-3 multisig wallet using the BSV Python library and test it by sending transactions to different addresses.
2. Use Chainalysis or CipherTrace to monitor the movement of BSV on the blockchain and identify any suspicious activity related to your investment.

# Assessment Types

This lesson provides an overview of various types of assessments in the context of Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand different types of assessment methods used in BSV.
2. Explain how each assessment type contributes to the overall security and transparency of the BSV network.
3. Demonstrate the use of Python or JavaScript for creating and verifying various types of assessments on the BSV blockchain.
4. Evaluate the trade-offs between different assessment methods in terms of scalability, privacy, and ease of implementation.

## Overview

Assessments play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and security of transactions on the BSV blockchain. This lesson covers four main types of assessments: proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-burn (PoB), proof-of-existence (PoX), and oracles.

## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

### Explanation

Proof-of-work is the original consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin and is still employed by BSV. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to find a solution receives a reward in the form of newly minted coins.

### Real-world Example

In a BSV mining pool, miners collaborate to increase their chances of finding the next valid block. When a member of the pool successfully solves the PoW problem, the rewards are distributed according to each miner's contributed computing power.

```python
# Python example for calculating the mining reward based on mining power (hashrate)
mining_reward = 6.25 # BSV reward per block
hashrate = 1000000000000 # Hashes per second
reward_per_hash = mining_reward / hashrate
print(f"Mining reward per hash: {reward_per_hash} satoshis")
```

## Proof-of-Burn (PoB)

### Explanation

Proof-of-burn is a consensus mechanism where participants "burn" (destroy) a certain amount of coins to prove their stake in the network and earn the right to create new blocks. The destroyed coins are sent to an unspendable address, effectively removing them from circulation.

### Real-world Example

To participate in PoB, users send a specified number of BSV coins to a specific "null" address, thus burning those coins. As a reward, they can then compete for creating the next block and receive newly minted coins as compensation.

```javascript
// JavaScript example demonstrating the cost of burning 1000 BSV using an unspendable address
const bsv = require('bsv');
const address = bsv.Address.fromHash160('SHA-256:<YOUR_NULL_ADDRESS_HASH>');
const tx = new bsv.Transaction();
tx.addOutput(address, 1000 * Math.pow(10, 8)); // Add output of 1000 BSV to the null address
const privateKey = bsv.PrivateKey.fromWIF('<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_WIF>');
tx.sign(privateKey);
const serializedTx = tx.serialize();
// Broadcast the transaction to the network
```

## Discussion Questions

1. How do PoW and PoB compare in terms of energy consumption and computational power requirements?
2. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of implementing PoB as a consensus mechanism on BSV?
3. Can you think of any real-world applications for PoB beyond participating in the BSV blockchain?

## Hands-on Exercises

1. Write Python or JavaScript code to calculate the number of BSV coins burned when sending 1000 BSV to a null address with your chosen implementation's specific hash.
2. Implement a simple Python script that simulates a mining pool and distributes rewards based on individual miner hashrates.
```

def get_bsv_blocks():
    url = "https://api.bitcoinsv.io/public/v1/blockchain/stats"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'xml')
    total_blocks = int(soup.find('totalblocks').text)
    return total_blocks

total_bsv_blocks = get_bsv_blocks()
print(f"Total Bitcoin SV blocks: {total_bsv_blocks}")
```

### Exercise

Write a Python script that calculates the average block time for Bitcoin SV. You can find the timestamp of each block in the [Bitcoin SV API](https://api.bitcoinsv.io/public/v1/blockchain/stats). Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when no data is available or when there are not enough blocks to calculate a meaningful average.

Hint: Python's datetime library can be useful for handling timestamps.
