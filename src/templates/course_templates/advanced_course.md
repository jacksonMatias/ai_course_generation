## Course Overview
This course dives deep into the *technical internals* and *enterprise-grade scaling* aspects of Bitcoin SV:

1. Analyse the BSV node architecture and networking stack.
2. Optimise transaction throughput for millions of TX/s.
3. Design large-scale data protocols (e.g., LiteClient, SPV Channels).
4. Build and benchmark high-volume smart-contract workloads.
5. Evaluate economic incentives & security at massive block sizes.

- *Capstone Prep:* Define performance targets

---

## Capstone Project
Design and deploy a **high-frequency trading analytics** platform that ingests >10 million tick events/day onto Bitcoin SV, providing real-time queries under 250 ms.

Deliverables:
- Architectural diagram (micro-services, queues, storage)
- Performance test results (charts & log snippets)
- Economic analysis of bandwidth vs. fee strategy
- Live demo or screencast (5 min)

---

## Assessment
1. **Theory Exam:** 20 advanced MCQs & 5 short-answer questions.
2. **Practical:** Optimise a sample Teranode config to exceed 50k TX/s.
3. **Peer Review:** Critique another student’s scaling strategy.

---

> **Instructor note:**
> Integrate latest protocol upgrade details (e.g., Arc 2, Teranode beta-features) before final release.
